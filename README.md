dataexplore
===========

This small tool serves as a visual evaluation of different features within a dataset. This evaluation (as of now) is very basic, and a more detailed version of it is under construction.

Usage:
```python
>>> from dataexplore import dataexplore
>>> data  = [[1,2,3], [4,5,5], [5,6,7], [5,4,2.3]]
>>> dataexplore(data)
```
Running this will generate the visual results.
